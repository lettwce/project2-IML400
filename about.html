            Dear user,<br>

            This website is built as a manifesto against the bureaucracy behind being an international student in the
            United
            States. As an immigrant, I am often forced to spend hours facing tons of information, forms, and documents
            all
            by myself. It often feels dreadful and unnecessary, other than occupying tons of time. Everything is very
            confusing, overwhelming, and discouraging. The immigration websites/career portals/USCIS are also extremely
            unhelpful and seem to make the processes even longer and more confusing, with unclear language and bad
            presentation of data. This way, users are thrown around signing in multiple websites and clicking on various
            links just to find simple information.
            Another important element of the immigration experience is the time limitation. As an international student,
            I
            am given 4 years to complete my degree, other than an extra year of OPT (Optional Practical Training) that
            allows me to work. After that, I have to apply for an H1-B visa (a work visa), which (1) has to be sponsored
            by
            your employer in an expensive process and (2) it is a random raffle, meaning that you risk not getting it.
            The
            other option is being eligible for a Green Card, which multiple people are not. In conclusion, other than
            having
            to be on top of tons of documents and forms, the international student is constricted to 4 years, or else
            they
            are literally kicked out of the country. It is all discouraging, and it makes you feel extremely discouraged
            to
            pursue a career. To be able to keep developing the life you built over 4 years, you need to be extraordinary
            to
            be hired by a big company that is willing to sponsor you. On top of that, you just have to be lucky.
            This website replicates through its structure the confusion and constraints of being an international
            student in
            the United States. I mostly tried to break the conventional website grid by making the process of finding
            information challenging. That means the text is either exhibited partially (and the information is
            incomplete)
            or it's hidden. This represents how challenging and oftentimes inconclusive the research you do is. The
            content
            itself does not matter much on the website, and it's mainly a way of showcasing the structure. Other pieces
            of
            information are contained spread and hidden around the page. You can either find them by hovering over them
            or
            clicking random spots. The time constraints are represented through the use of an hourglass-shaped text that
            is
            constantly turning and the countdown on the top right of the page. The countdown showcases the number of
            days in
            4 years and once it goes to 0, the page closes, leaving the user with a letter, politely kicking them out of
            the
            country. If you click on it, it shows the message "you are not welcome", which is the overall feeling of
            being
            in this position. The intention is for the user to not have time to go through all the information.
            If further developed, this website would become a tool for showcasing easy-to-access information and
            tutorials
            about the experience of being an international student, as an attempt to help people who go through the same
            issues and confusion.
