        <h1 class = "letter-title">Urgent: Expiration of Your Student Visa and Required Action</h1>
        <p id="message">
            Dear Student,<br>
            <br>
            This letter is to inform you that your student visa has expired as of today. <br>
            As a result, you are no longer authorized to remain in the United States under the conditions of your current visa status.
            We understand that this may be an unexpected and stressful situation. However, it is 
            important to note that all international students must maintain valid visa status throughout 
            their stay in the U.S. <br>
            In accordance with U.S. immigration laws, failure to depart the country promptly 
            after visa expiration can lead to serious consequences, including but not limited to: <br>
            <br>
            1. Inadmissibility: Future visa applications may be affected, and you could be barred from 
            re-entering the U.S. for a specified period of time.<br>
            2. Unlawful Presence: Remaining in the U.S. beyond your authorized stay can lead 
            to the accumulation of unlawful presence, which may further complicate future immigration 
            proceedings.<br>
            <br>
            To avoid these complications, we strongly recommend that you make arrangements to leave the country 
            within 30 days from the expiration date of your visa or seek legal advice regarding your options 
            for extending or adjusting your immigration status.
            If you believe that this notification is in error or if you have filed a visa extension or change 
            of status request that has not yet been adjudicated, please contact the U.S. Citizenship and 
            Immigration Services (USCIS) immediately for clarification. Any delay in resolving this matter 
            could result in further action against your immigration status. <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. <br>
            <br>
            Sincerely,
            <br>
            U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)
        </p>
